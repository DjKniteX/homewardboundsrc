Homeward Bound
You are a Rex; A very known goodboy in a city somewhere in the state. Everybody loves you.. Until one day, you were picked up and blindfolded, Unaware of where you are, you wake up in a small cell.

But you remember stories other animals have told you about there being disappearances. About 99% of the time, they never come back or the other 1% just don't remember anything. 

It's time for you to escape and warn everybody that this is not a joke.

Can you escape?
A small game developed in pico-8 by a small indie team, Team SKYNITE. A test game in a series of games that we are planning for the Game Off 2019. Our goal was to see if we can complete a game as junior developers/hobbyists. With the completion of our first simple game, we decided to take on another project to continue the storyline (with actual story!)
